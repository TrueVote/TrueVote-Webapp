# TrueVote Web-Application

## Introduction

This repository has webapp implementations of TrueVote. There are two frameworks currently that we are trying to build out: one is Vue, and the other is React. Our group mostly had experience in Vue, but we didn't want the use and/or contributions to be limited by that framework. Some base code has been created for React, but that portion is much further behind.
